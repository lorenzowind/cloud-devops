# Cloud DevOps Infrastructure as code

## Getting Started with CloudFormation
- Describe Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC) as one of the best practices used in the DevOps model.
- Configure basic settings to start using AWS services as an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user.
- Explain the fundamentals of Cloud Formation.
- Contrast the manual vs. automated (script-based) provisioning of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- Utilize the AWS command-line tool - CLI for necessary activities, such as configuring a VPC, or creating an IAM user.

## Infrastructure Diagrams
- Make use of www.lucidchart.com to draw the diagram.
- Identify the AWS resources that are required to be used in the diagram.
- Place the resources correctly in the diagram, such as VPC, availability zones, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, autoscaling groups, load balancers, and EC2 instances.

## Networking Infrastructure
- Describe the syntax of the CloudFormation code that builds the infrastructure
- Build the following resources - Virtual Private Cloud and subnets, Internet gateway and NAT gateway, Route table
- Export the stack output

## Servers and Security Groups
- Specify firewall rules using security groups
- Create autoscaling groups for the elasticity of servers
- Code the launch configuration for the web application
- Add the target groups and listeners
- Update the stack with the load balancer
- Learn to debug the security group
